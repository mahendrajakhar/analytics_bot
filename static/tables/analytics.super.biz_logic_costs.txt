Table: analytics.super.biz_logic_costs
Description: Contains cost-related data for business logic, including advertising costs, impressions, clicks, and campaign details.

Possible Primary Key: While no single column is explicitly unique, a composite key could be created. The best candidate would be a combination of date_tz, adn_campaign_id, adn_sub_campaign_id, and adn_creative_id. If this combination is not unique, a surrogate id column would need to be added. We will assume a surrogate key exists and name is just 'id'.
Primary Key: id

Foreign Keys (Potential/Inferred):
adn_campaign_id -> (Likely relates to a campaigns table, but we don't have it in the provided schema. We'll infer a table named ad_campaigns).
adn_sub_campaign_id -> (Likely relates to a sub_campaigns table, or potentially also the inferred ad_campaigns table, representing a hierarchical relationship).
adn_creative_id -> (Likely relates to a creatives table, which we'll infer as ad_creatives).
campaign_show_id -> (Likely relates to a shows table, defining which show the campaign is associated with).
campaign_show_name -> shows.show_name(less likely to be use, but it will exist)

Relationships:
One-to-many with inferred ad_campaigns (one campaign can have many cost records).
One-to-many with inferred ad_sub_campaigns (one sub-campaign can have many cost records).
One-to-many with inferred ad_creatives (one creative can have many cost records).
One-to-many with inferred shows (one show can have many associated campaigns and therefore cost records).
Many to one to other columns of the same table (biz_logic_costs) via columns campaign_show_id and campaign_show_name.

Implicit/Joinable Fields:
date_tz: Could be joined with date fields in other tables (e.g., biz_logic_v2.sdate_tz, free_trial_orders.order_tz, etc.) for time-based analysis.
language, category, channel, biz_type, campaign_country, type, platform_type, subscription_model: These fields represent dimensions that could be used to join with similar fields in other tables, or to filter and aggregate data.
cost_source, marketing_source: These fields provide further granularity for relating costs to marketing activities.
adn_campaign_name (this would be linked with biz_logic_v2.campaign_name, and campaign)
purpose,source->free_trial_orders.source, biz_logic_v2.purpose, and premium_user_all_orders.source
